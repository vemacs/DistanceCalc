DistanceCalc
============

A small plugin that tells users their distance from spawn.

Usage
-----

All the user needs to do is run '/distance', and it tells the user their 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional distance from spawn.

Permissions
-----------

The permission 'DistanceCalc.calc', which should be given by default, allows the user to check their distance from spawn.

Configuration
-------------

Be sure to edit the 'config.yml' to be your spawn's y-position. The Bukkit getSpawnLocation doesn't do this properly.

Commands
--------

'/distance' reports to the player how far they are from spawn, in both 2d and 3d
